**Rocket Science**

This is a sandbox app for cultivating modern CSS and Javascript skills.

The content is based around winners of the major SF literary prizes (the Hugo Award for Best Novel; the Nebula award; The Arthur C. Clarke Award). The objective is to be able to display and sort data in various cases, for example:
* If I own the text.
* If I've read the text.
* Compare winners of a given year's prize.

Note that the project's principle purpose is skill development: overall user satisfaction is a secondary (although not unimportant) outcome.

This is not a production-oriented project. Be aware that I've consciously used techniques that may not work, or work as expected, in older browsers, especially Internet Explorer.

**Normalize.css**
[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)  makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
