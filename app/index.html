                <blockquote>
                    <q>Today we live in a society in which spurious realities are manufactured by the media, by governments, by big corporations, by religious groups, political groups... So I ask, in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power: that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind. I ought to know. I do the same thing.</q>

                <blockquote>
                    <q>Science fiction is the most important literature in the history of the world, because it's the history of ideas, the history of our civilization birthing itself. [...] Science fiction is central to everything we've ever done, and people who make fun of science fiction writers don't know what they're talking about.</q>
