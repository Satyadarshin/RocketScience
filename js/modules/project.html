    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>All of the output you see here was written in modern HTML, CSS, and vanilla (ES6) javaScript as far as practicable. It&rsquo;s an open-ended project, the purpose of which is to add little problems for no other reason than to solve them.</p>            
    <p>The project was developed for Firefox and makes zero concessions to broader browser support (I make no attempt to support Internet Explorer). Clearly this isn&rsquo;t acceptable in a production project, but to emphasise, this is a self-training sandbox, so if something doesn&rsquo;t work, or looks clumsy, that&rsquo;s within project scope.</p>
    <h3>About the data</h3>
    <p>Because this is a training project, I&rsquo;ve restricted myself to browser-native JavaScript. The award lists are stored as regular JSON files, not in a database.</p>
